Phaser BitmapText test
======================
This is a html5/javascript example to test Phaser.Bitmaptext using a JSON file instead of an XML file.
This is needed for deploying an Phaser game on CocoonJS.

I've added a variable TEST_FONT_JSON which replaces the "if (navigator.isCocoonJS)"
so I can recreate and test the code example in the Chrome desktop browser.
This example doesn't seem to work but I don't know why.
